# Dependency Injection in Node

Reasons for building it:

 - bored of the list of `require` at the top of each module
 - bored of finding out the location of a module relative to another one for requiring it
 - challanging myself to build something useful
 - missing the comfort of dependecy injection components like SwiftSuspenders (ActionScript)
 - ease the maintenance of big applications
